- Use gpu instead of cpu.

- Load balance for the gpu.

- Caching for reoccuring images (checksum)
    - This reduces the need to repeatedly process the same images, saving time and resources.

- Handle requests in batches
    - This can reduce the overhead of handling individual requests and is particularly effective in GPU-based processing.

- Use the most efficient image encodings (jpg - JPEG2000)
    - Can minimize network latency and reduce processing time on both client and server sides.
